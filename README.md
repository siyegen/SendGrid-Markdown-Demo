# SendGrid Markdown Demo

This is a demo showing how simple it is to use
[SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/) with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  Using a
simple static file server and websockets, this demo takes emails written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and sends them
using the SendGrid mail API in real time.
